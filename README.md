### Optional

- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#installation-methods)

## Your stack

This starter has been initialized with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) which is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. (And more precisely [react-ts](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-n1nea3?file=index.html&terminal=dev) template).

Next to that, you have interesting **tools which are already configure** :
